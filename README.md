#Snapify

The idea of project is to explore the music in an innovative way by creating a recommender system which can play the song depending upon your mood or surroundings captured in the input snap. I worked on this with my team-mates during Spotify Hackathon 2018. We integrated google cloud's vision api with couple of Spotify's api to build this.
